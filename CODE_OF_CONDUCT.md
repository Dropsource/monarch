# Code of conduct

We expect Monarch community members to act professionally and respectfully, and we expect our social spaces to be safe and dignified environments.

Specifically:

- Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
- Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
- Listen. Consider and acknowledge people’s points before responding.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the Monarch project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate. We will not tolerate harassment from anyone in the Monarch community, even outside of Monarch’s public communication channels.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please [email us](support@monarchapp.io).
