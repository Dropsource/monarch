## About Monarch
Monarch is an open source tool for building Flutter widgets in isolation. It makes it easy to build, test and debug complex UIs.

Monarch is inspired by [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). 

### Build widgets faster
**Write stories**  
Write stories to isolate your widgets. Then preview stories without running your app or backend.  

**Browse your stories**  
Monarch lets you verify your UI without an emulatorâ€”free up memory and resources.

### Find and fix bugs with ease
**Find bugs**  
Stories render edge cases with little effort. Mock dependencies to render visual states that are hard to reproduce.

**Fix bugs**  
From your stories, navigate to your code to fix bugs. Monarch renders your fixes faster than an emulator.

**Test your UI**  
Reuse your stories from your widget tests.

### Build responsive UIs easily
**See your widgets in different modes**  
Make sure your UI works across multiple devices, text scales, languages, and themes.

**Hot reload your changes**  
Tune your UI easily with hot reload. Monarch automatically reloads your changes.

### Debug widgets in isolation
**Visual Debugging**  
Fine-tune animations, fix layout issues, align text. Find images using too much memory.

**Debug in isolation**  
Debug widgets without running your app or backend. And Use DevTools.
