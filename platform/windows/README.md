# WIP

- Write a little bit about how the build works
- Then mention that there are visual studio solutions in each build/{flutter_sdk} directory
- That each solution includes references to the source files in the src directory
- There is only one src directory 
- How each flutter version has its own build directory and its own generated visual studio solution
- To debug or edit the code, open up the visual studio sln file
- Once the solution is open, make the project monarch_windows_app the startup project (Set as Startup Project)
- Should I list pre-requisites? Knowledge of C++, CMake and Visual Studio
- That the version number and app icon are taken from build_settings.yaml
